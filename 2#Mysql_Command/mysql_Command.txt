Can I get the count of repeated values in a column with MySQL?

1#.select status,count(station_id) from station group by status order by count(station_id) DESC
  mysql query:->

  #.SELECT status, COUNT( status ) x FROM station GROUP BY status HAVING x >1
  #.select status,count(station_id) as ValueCount from station group by status order by count(station_id) DESC
